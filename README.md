## Dev

Viewing asciidoc directly on github has important limitations. The nicest features of asciidoc simply do not work (e.g. theming, custom icons). Therefore, it seems very difficult to use Github as a platform for distributing the material (asciidoc content of slides and tutorial guides) and viewing it nicely at the same time. To mitigate this, I propose:

splitting source files (asciidoc files) from build files ready for distribution and offline-viewing (pdf files)
providing instructions on how to render the reveal-js and asciidoc files on a browser (dev only, but which students can also use for rendering the content on their browsers)
setting up a server on the University server which will render the slides and allow incoming connections from students.
With this, I think we can distribute the material in a nice format (pdf file) and, at the same time, provide access the source files, together with instructions on how to render them in the browser. If they are not comfortable with this, they can instead connect to the internal server for viewing the content in the browser.
