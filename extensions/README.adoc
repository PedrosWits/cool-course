== Asciidoc extensions

Asciidoc extensions live here. These help us customise or add functionality to some of the great things about asciidoc. One example is an extension that implements a new type of admonition block.

To include an extension when converting an asciidoc file to html with `asciidoctor`, use the `-r` option. For instance:

```shell
asciidoctor -r ./extensions/hero-block.rb extensions/hero-block/sample.adoc   # on parent dir
```

Open the resulting sample html file on the browser:
```shell
open extensions/hero-block/sample.html  # macOS
```
